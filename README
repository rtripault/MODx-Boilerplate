Trying to streamline MODx Revolution integration.

NOTE : try it on a fresh MODx install ONLY (or expect some mess/data loose)

Build your package :
====================
1 - git clone git://github.com/MeltingMedia/MODx-Boilerplate.git
2 - copy files in your modx base path (according you did a traditonnal install)
3 - rename _build/build.config.sample.php to _build/build.config.php
4 - execute _build/build.transport.php (either via php cli or by browsing the file : http://yourdomain.tld/_build/build.transport.php)
5 - install via package manager
6 - report errors/suggestionsâ€¦ https://github.com/MeltingMedia/MODx-Boilerplate/issues
